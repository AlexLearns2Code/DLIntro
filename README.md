Hello World of Deep Learning Projects ! :) Hand written Digit identifier

Two ways to run this code :

1.you can run the python code file(handwrittendigitreader.py) natively on your machine if all the dependencies are already installed.

Else,
2. you can directly import the .ipynb file into a Google colab notebook ,if you want to run it on cloud,this way you dont need to install all the dependencies natively.

Dependencies :
Tensorflow
keras
matplotlib
numpy

This code snippet is trained on mnist dataset of images(of size28*28) of handwritten digits.
after proper training and validation it will predict the digit from the test image with accuracy of ~98%
